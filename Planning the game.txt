var enemyHP
var userHP
var enemyAttackPower
var userAttackPower
var enemyArray [] ????

    ? how do i make html so i can put an index of the array into it?
    ? how do i get an index and 'battle' by comparing hp and attackpowers?
    ? would i use a function to select the user and the enemy?

var enemyArray = [
    name: 
]

reset function () {}


    Set stages variable to control when event occur
    - stage = start (select the users character)
    
    
    - stage = enemy (select the enemy from list, after stage start is complete)

    - stage = attack (begin the attack function, after stage enemy is complete)



Attack function
    Stage = attack

    .on click to start function {

    Attack the enemy
    - HP of enemy -= attack power 
    - $(html).text(hpBalance)

    Enemy attacks
    - HP of user -= attack power of enemy 
    - $(html).text(hpBalance)

    Increase the user attack power
    - userAttackPower += userAttackPower =var userAttackPower

    Compare statements
    - if (userHP <= 0) { 
         $(html).text(Game Over);
         reset();
    }
    - else if (enemyHP <= 0)  {
            selectNewEnemy()
            
        } 
    }  // will end and wait for a click
            


             nextEnemy()
