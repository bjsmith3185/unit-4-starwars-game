var enemyHP
var userHP
var enemyAttackPower
var userAttackPower
var enemyArray [] ????

    ? how do i make html so i can put an index of the array into it?
    ? how do i get an index and 'battle' by comparing hp and attackpowers?
    ? would i use a function to select the user and the enemy?

var enemyArray = [
    name: 
]

reset function () {
    this moves all characer divs back to the top of the page
    sets the stage variable to start
    maybe alert box telling to select the first player?
}
-------------
    Set stages variable to control when event occur
    - stage = start (select the users character)
      
    - stage = enemy (select the enemy from list, after stage start is complete)

    - stage = attack (begin the attack function, after stage enemy is complete)

    - stage = 2ndEnemy  after first is defeated, allowing the next to be moved

    - stage = 2ndEnemyAttack  let the attack function run

    - stage = 3rdEnemy  after the 2nd is defeated, moves last to the location

    - stage = 3rdEnemyAttack  lets the attack function run


? how to get the data from the user's choice and the enemy to begin the attack?

can i reference the "users div" to retreive the HP and attackpower data?
can i reference the "enemy div" to retreive the HP and attackpower data?




Attack function
    Stage = attack

    .on click to start function {

    Attack the enemy
    - HP of enemy -= attack power 
    - $(html).text(hpBalance)

    Enemy attacks
    - HP of user -= attack power of enemy 
    - $(html).text(hpBalance)

    Increase the user attack power
    - userAttackPower += userAttackPower 

    Compare statements
    - if (userHP <= 0) { 
         $(html).text(Game Over);
         reset();
    }
    - else if (enemyHP <= 0)  {
            selectNewEnemy()
            
        } 
    }  // will end and wait for a click
